# YouBulletin
A lightweight, mobile-responsive PHP bulletin board for sharing YouTube videos.

Videos are uploaded by users, who may choose to be anonymous. The homepage shows a list of recent videos. When a video is watched, it is pushed to the top of the homepage, so in this way the most interesting videos stay on the site the longest.

Each video includes a comment section for discussion. Video uploading and commenting has basic spam-protection.

Requires a web server with PHP and MySQL. To install, simply clone into a directory and modify config.php and sql.php. The SQL database will be setup automatically.
